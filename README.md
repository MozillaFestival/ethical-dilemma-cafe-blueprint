# What is the Ethical Dilemma Café?

The Ethical Dilemma Café is a public space where  individuals are invited to take part in  installations, participate in discussions, and attend workshops that explore the pressing ethical issues surrounding the use of personal data today.

At the Café, your personal data is your currency. Each Café revolves around a ‘Dilemma’ - a common online problem we encounter everyday. Attendees are presented with scenarios where they must decide their own ethical boundaries. How much would you reveal about yourself for a free coffee? What about the latest smartphone? Or for a once-in-a-lifetime travel experience? Each scenario prompts you to evaluate the real cost of your privacy, consider how much you’re willing to compromise your identity and where you draw the line.

Each dilemma challenges how much personal data you’re willing to expose and the extent of responsibility you're prepared to accept as your data shapes your identity and your community, potentially forever.

The Café is designed to be an open, inclusive, and safe environment, encouraging discussions on the ethical implications of data collection and usage. Serving as a platform for addressing broader data-related issues, we aim to explore how we can reclaim our agency in the face of these dilemmas and work towards a healthier digital future.
